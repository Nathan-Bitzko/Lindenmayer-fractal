# Lindenmayer-fractal
python program to generate Lindenmayer fractals

#ToDo - add loading bar, big fractals can take a while to generate with no indication that it is happening to the user

axiom is the starting rule. ignore vars are vars to draw a transparent line for angle is 
the angle to turn when a + or - is found. - turns right + turns left. "[" logs current 
location and angle and "]" returns to last logged location. iterations is the number times 
replacments are done on the starting axiom

for those theoretical computer scientists out there, the fractal is contructed from a series 
of rules that make up a context free grammar.
